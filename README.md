# AI CrossMath: A CSP-Based Puzzle 

**Project Description**:  
This repository contains a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** solver implemented for the *CrossMath* puzzle, along with solutions for *Sudoku* and *Map Coloring* problems. Developed as part of an Artificial Intelligence course (2024), the project demonstrates backtracking algorithms with heuristics like **MRV (Minimum Remaining Values)** and **LCV (Least Constraining Value)**.

### Key Features  
- **CrossMath Solver**: Solves arithmetic grid puzzles using CSP constraints (e.g., `A + B = C`).  
- **Sudoku & Map Coloring**: Extended CSP implementations for classic problems.  
- **Optimizations**:  
  - Forward checking to prune search spaces.  
  - MRV and LCV heuristics for efficient variable/value selection.  
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend for new CSP problems.
